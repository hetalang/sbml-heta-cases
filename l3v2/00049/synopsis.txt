The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 0-dimensional.  The model contains two
reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*         |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1          |$1.0 \x 10^-1$ | mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2          |$2.0 \x 10^-1$ | mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3          |$1.0 \x 10^-1$ | mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1         |$         0.75$ | mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2         |$         0.25$ | second^-1^ |]

In this example, the compartment has its spatialDimensions attribute set to
zero, i.e., it represents a point and therefore cannot have size or units.
The species values must be treated as amounts and not concentrations.
