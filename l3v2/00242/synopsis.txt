The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 0-dimensional.  Both species S2 and S3 are
labeled as an SBML boundary species.  The model contains two reactions
defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|      |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1  |$1.0 \x 10^-15$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2  |$2.0 \x 10^-15$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3  |$1.0 \x 10^-15$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1 |$         0.75$ |mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2 |$         0.25$ |second^-1^ |]

In this example the compartment has its spatialDimensions attribute set to
zero; i.e., it represents a point and therefore cannot have size or units.
The species values must be treated as amounts and not concentrations.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical solution
of the system of equations.
