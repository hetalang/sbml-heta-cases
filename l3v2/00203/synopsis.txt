The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 2-dimensional.  The model contains two
reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * compartment$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * compartment$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1              |$ 1.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2              |$ 2.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3              |$ 1.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1             |$           75$ |metre^2^ mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2             |$           25$ |second^-1^ |
|Area of compartment "compartment" |$          3.7$ |metre^2^                  |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
