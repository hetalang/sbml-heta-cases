The model contains one compartment called C.  There are two
species called S1 and S2 and one parameter called k1.  The model contains one
reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $C * multiply(k1,S1)$  |]


The model contains one functionDefinition defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Id*  |  *Arguments*  |  *Formula*  |
 | multiply | x, y | $x * y$ |]


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial concentration of S1   |$1.5 \x 10^-3$ |mole litre^-1^                      |
|Initial concentration of S2   |$1.5 \x 10^-3$ |mole litre^-1^                      |
|Value of parameter k1         |$            1$ |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment C       |$          2.3$ |litre                     |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical solution
of the system of equations.
