The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.  Species S1
is labeled as both constant and an SBML boundary condition, and therefore cannot 
be changed by rules or reactions.  The model contains one reaction defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $compartment * k2 * S1$  |]

The model contains one rule:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Assignment | S3       | $k1 * S2$  |]

In this case there is no initial value declared for species S3.  Thus the
initial value must be calculated by the assignmentRule.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$1.0 \x 10^-1$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$1.5 \x 10^-1$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$   undeclared$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$         1.05$ |dimensionless             |
|Value of parameter k2               |$         1.15$ |second^-1^                |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$            1$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
