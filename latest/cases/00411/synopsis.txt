synopsis:      Basic two reactions with three species in one compartment
               and one event that assigns value to a species using a function,
               subject to a delay.

The model contains one compartment called C.  There are three species
called S1, S2 and S3 and four parameters called k1, k2, k3 and k4.  The
model contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * C$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * C$     |]

The model contains one event that assigns a value to species S2:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| | *Trigger*  | *Delay* | *Assignments* |
 | Event1                      | $S1 < 0.5$ | $0.5$   | $S2 = add(k3, k4)$    |]
 
The eventAssignment uses a functionDefinition defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Id*  |  *Arguments*  |  *Formula*  |
 |                             add    | x, y          | $x + y$     |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value* |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1          |$1.0$   |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2          |$2.0$   |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3          |$1.0$   |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1         |$0.75$  |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2         |$0.25$  |second^-1^                |
|Value of parameter k3         |$0.8$   |mole litre^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k4         |$0.2$   |mole litre^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment C       |$1$     |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
