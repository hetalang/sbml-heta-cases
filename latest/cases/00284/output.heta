The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are four
species named S1, S2, S3 and S4 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 2-dimensional.  The model contains two
reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 + S4 | $multiply(k1,multiply(S1,S2)) * compartment$  |
| S3 + S4 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * S4 * compartment$  |]


The model contains one functionDefinition defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Id*  |  *Arguments*  |  *Formula*  |
 | multiply | x, y | $x * y$ |]


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1              |$0.9 \x 10^-2$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2              |$1.1 \x 10^-2$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3              |$1.2 \x 10^-2$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4              |$1.0 \x 10^-2$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1             |$12.75 \x 10^1$ |metre^2^ mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2             |$0.25 \x 10^1$ |metre^2^ mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Area of compartment "compartment" |$         1.98$ |metre^2^                  |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
