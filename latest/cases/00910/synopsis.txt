The model contains two varying compartments called C1 and C2, where C1 
is 1-dimensional and C2 is 2-dimensional.

The model contains two rules:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Rate | C1       | $C2 * 0.5 + C1 * 0.3$  |
 | Rate | C2       | $C1 * 0.1 + C2 * 0.2$  |]


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*   |*Units*  |
|Size of compartment C1        |$1.5 x 10^-2^$     |metre        |
|Size of compartment C2        |$1.0 x 10^-2^$     |metre^2^ |]

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
