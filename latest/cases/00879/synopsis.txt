The model contains one compartment called C.  There are four
species named S1, S2, S3 and S4 and three parameters named k1, k2 and k3.
The model contains three reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 -> S2 | $k1 * S1 * C$  |
| S2 -> S3 | $k2 * S2 * C$  |
| S3 -> S4 | $k3 * S3 * C$  |] 

The model contains one initialAssignment:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| Variable | Formula |
 | k1       | $0.2 + k2* exp(t)$  |]
where the symbol 't' denotes the current simulation time.

Note: SBML's InitialAssignment take effect at time t < 0 and continue to have effect 
up to and including time t = 0, overriding any initial values.  In this model, the 
initial value for the parameter k1 has not been explicitly declared and must be 
calculated using the InitialAssignment at time = 0. 

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole           |
|Initial amount of S2                |$0$              |mole           |
|Initial amount of S3                |$0$              |mole           |
|Initial amount of S4                |$0$              |mole           |
|Value of parameter k1               |$undeclared$     |second^-2^     |
|Value of parameter k2               |$0.5$            |second^-2^     |
|Value of parameter k3               |$1$              |second^-2^     |
|Volume of compartment C |$1$              |litre          |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical
solution of the system of equations.
