The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.  The model
contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| 2S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S1 * S2 * compartment$  |
| S3 -> 2S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * compartment$        |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                         |
|Initial amount of S2                |$2.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                         |
|Initial amount of S3                |$1.0 \x 10^-4$  |mole                         |
|Value of parameter k1               |$1.0 \x 10^4$   |litre^2^ mole^-2^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$0.25$           |second^-1^                   |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$1$              |litre                        |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
