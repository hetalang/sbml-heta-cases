The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 1-dimensional.  The model contains two
reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $multiply(k1, S1, S2) * compartment$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * compartment$  |]


The model contains one functionDefinition defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Id*  |  *Arguments*  |  *Formula*  |
 | multiply | x, y, z | $x * y * z$ |]


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$ 1.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$ 2.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$ 1.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$         3.24$ |metre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$        0.125$ |second^-1^ |
|Length of compartment "compartment" |$          6.8$ |metre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
