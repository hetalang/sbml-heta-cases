The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are five
species named S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 1-dimensional.  Species S5 is labeled as
constant and therefore cannot be changed by rules or reactions.  The model
contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 + S4 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * compartment$  |
| S3 + S4 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * S4 * compartment / S5$  |]


The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$ 1.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$ 1.5 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$ 2.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4                |$ 0.5 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S5                |$ 1.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$  1.3 \x 10^6$ |metre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$          0.3$ |metre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Length of compartment "compartment" |$            1$ |metre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
