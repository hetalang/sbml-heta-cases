The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are four
species called S1, S2, S3 and S4; one constant parameter called k2 and one
varying parameter called k2.  The model contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 + S4 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * compartment$  |
| S3 + S4 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * S4 * compartment$  |]

The model contains one rule which defines that rate at which parameter k1
varies:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Type*  |  *Variable*  |  *Formula*  |
 | Rate | k1 | $10^6$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*         |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$ 1.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$ 1.5 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$ 2.0 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4                |$ 0.5 \x 10^-6$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$    1 \x 10^6$ |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$  0.3 \x 10^6$ |litre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment "compartment" |$            1$ |litre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
