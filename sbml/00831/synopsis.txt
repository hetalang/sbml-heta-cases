The model contains one compartment called C.  There are two species called 
S1 and S2.  The model contains  two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 <-> S2 | $(kf * S1 - kr * S2) * C$  |
| S3 <-> S4 | $(kf * S3 - kr * S4) * C$  |]

Both reactions define two local parameters kf and kr which have a
scope local to the defining reaction.

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}| |*Value*       |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1        |$1.0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2        |$0$ |mole                      |
|Value of local parameter kf (R1)       |$0.8$          |second^-1^ |
|Value of local parameter kr (R1)      |$0.06$          |second^-1^ |
|Value of local parameter kf (R1)      |$0.9$          |second^-1^ |
|Value of local parameter kr (R2)      |$0.075$          |second^-1^ |
|Volume of compartment C     |$1$             |litre                  |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.
