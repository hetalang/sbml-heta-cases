The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are three
species named S1, S2 and S3 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 1-dimensional.  Both species S1 and S2 are
labeled as an SBML boundary species.  The model contains two reactions
defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2 * compartment$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * compartment$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|       |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1                |$          1.0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2                |$          2.0$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3                |$          1.5$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1               |$          7.5$ |metre mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2               |$          0.3$ |second^-1^ |
|Length of compartment "compartment" |$            1$ |metre                     |]

The species values are given as amounts of substance to make it easier to
use the model in a discrete stochastic simulator, but (as per usual SBML
principles) their symbols represent their values in concentration units
where they appear in expressions.

Note: The test data for this model was generated from an analytical solution
of the system of equations.
