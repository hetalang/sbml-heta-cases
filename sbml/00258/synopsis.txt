The model contains one compartment called "compartment".  There are four
species named S1, S2, S3 and S4 and two parameters named k1 and k2.
Compartment "compartment" is 0-dimensional.  Species S4 is labeled as
constant and therefore cannot be changed by rules or reactions.  The model
contains two reactions defined as:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|  *Reaction*  |  *Rate*  |
| S1 + S2 -> S3 | $k1 * S1 * S2$  |
| S3 -> S1 + S2 | $k2 * S3 * S4$  |]

The initial conditions are as follows:

[{width:30em,margin: 1em auto}|      |*Value*          |*Units*  |
|Initial amount of S1  |$ 1.0 \x 10^-3$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S2  |$ 1.5 \x 10^-3$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S3  |$0.75 \x 10^-3$ |mole                      |
|Initial amount of S4  |$1.25 \x 10^-3$ |mole                      |
|Value of parameter k1 |$ 1.68 \x 10^3$ |mole^-1^ second^-1^ |
|Value of parameter k2 |$ 0.27 \x 10^3$ |mole^-1^ second^-1^ |]

In this example the compartment has its spatialDimensions attribute set to
zero; i.e., it represents a point and therefore cannot have size or units.
The species values must be treated as amounts and not concentrations.
